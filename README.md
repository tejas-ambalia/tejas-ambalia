# Tech Lead & Full-Stack Architect

I help organizations design, build, and operate **secure, scalable web platforms** that support **large user bases and critical business workflows**.

With **9+ years of experience**, I work closely with leadership and engineering teams to take **end-to-end ownership** of system architecture, delivery, and long-term maintainability.

## Where I Add Value

I’m usually engaged when:

- systems are approaching scale and architectural decisions start to matter  
- performance or security issues create operational or business risk  
- existing platforms need stabilization or modernization  
- internal processes require automation to reduce cost and error  
- teams need senior technical ownership and clear direction

## What I Deliver

- architecture designed for **scale, resilience, and clarity**  
- custom ERPs and internal platforms supporting critical operations  
- high-traffic public portals with strict availability requirements  
- performance optimization and security hardening  
- automation that reduces operational overhead  
- sustained technical ownership beyond initial delivery  

My focus is on **predictable systems, clear trade-offs, and long-term reliability**.
